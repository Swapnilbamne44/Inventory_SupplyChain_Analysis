Inventory Supply Chain Management Analysis, focusing on optimizing various facets of the supply chain. Key solutions include detailed tracking and management of inventory levels across diverse product categories such as Clothing, Electronics, Furniture, and Accessories, with a breakdown by East, North, South, and West regions, allowing for precise stock monitoring. Furthermore, the analysis emphasizes optimizing warehouse utilization, a critical aspect for efficient storage and operations. 
The project also provides robust monitoring of order statuses, covering fulfilled, pending, backorder, and canceled orders, which aids in identifying and resolving potential bottlenecks in the order fulfillment process. Beyond operational aspects, the solutions delve into analyzing supply chain costs and efficiency through metrics like the sum of transportation cost, average lead time, days sales of inventory, and inventory turnover ratio, aiming for cost reduction and improved supply chain speed. Lastly, the inclusion of the sum of units sold enables tracking sales performance and its direct impact on inventory planning. Overall, the project delivers data-driven analytical solutions to enhance inventory and supply chain operations, ultimately leading to improved efficiency, reduced costs, and optimized stock management.
